The framework consists of the categories and subcategories that the automated model will assign the qualitative data to. The framework has multiple categories, each with their own set of sub-categories. A broad overview of the framework is displayed below. Fuller details are available on the Framework details page.

When thinking about the categories and sub-categories, the categories can be thought of as the overarching heading, grouping similar or related topics together in a meaningful way to help end users navigate the framework more easily. The sub-categories are more specific and better reflect the underlying data. 

Each sub-category has a description of what the data mapped there covers, for example:

| **Category**                      | **Sub-category**                          | **Sub-category description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Environment, equipment & catering | Cleanliness, tidiness & infection control | Comments relating to the cleanliness and tidiness of the environment and equipment (for example wards, rooms, toilets, furniture). It also incorporates how timely, efficient, and thorough cleaning/ maintenance staff are in addressing related issues, and the frequency of cleaning. Includes feedback on the rules to prevent the spread of infection e.g., use of PPE/ face masks, and adherence to guidelines in relation to this. |



Here are some examples of qualitative data that would map to the ‘Cleanliness, tidiness & infection control’ sub-category described above:


> 'the cleaning lady was thorough' 

> 'Ward is well organised ,kept clean and tidy'

> 'Nice ward was clean and tidy. Toilets was clean and the bay in general.'

> 'The ambulance was very clean.'

> 'Cleaner ward - dirty.’

> 'Wiping bed tables , did this myself as was not done during my 3 day stay.'

> 'it was unclean & when I complained about silver fish in the bathroom was told the maintenance men wouldn't come out for them', 

> 'Masks not effective & not worn correctly. No social distancing.'
