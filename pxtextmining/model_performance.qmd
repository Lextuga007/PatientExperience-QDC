Thanks to the 21000 comments painstakingly and expertly labelled as part of this project, we had a very rich dataset with which to train our machine learning models. The best performing models were the Support Vector Classifier, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (XGBoost), and Distilbert, a transformer-based large language model. For the multilabel categories, we found that these three models were largely comparable to one another but that they produced the best results when combined together. The Distilbert model outperformed the others for predicting text sentiment (i.e., positive/negative/neutral).

Please see below the final performance metrics for the models that we have trained and which are available via the API. These are also available in alternative formats to download from our [github repository](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/pxtextmining/tree/main/current_best_model).

## Distilbert sentiment model

The model is trained to predict to a five-point sentiment scale. However, we would recommend mapping this to a three-point sentiment scale, as advised by the qualitative analysts at NHS England.

| Score | Five point sentiment scale | Three point sentiment scale |
| ----- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1     | Very positive              | Positive                    |
| 2     | Positive                   | Positive                    |
| 3     | Neutral / mixed            | Neutral / mixed             |
| 4     | Negative                   | Negative                    |
| 5     | Very negative              | Negative                    |
